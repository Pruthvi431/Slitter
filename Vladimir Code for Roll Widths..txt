To simplify the interface, I have created a new table - [production].[winder_set] in the production database. Just add roll widths to that table for each completed set.
The table has the following columns

pattern_no              - pattern number sent by JVCS interface
pattern_set_no          - sequential set number (restarts with new pattern)
position_no             - roll position
width                    - roll width in cm
grade_code              - grade code sent by JVCS
diameter                - set diameter
date_created            - date when the set was completed

You can fill and clean the table for testing purposes. That will not cause any side effect.
