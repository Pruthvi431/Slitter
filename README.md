# Introduction
Receives orders from Sales system (Wrapmation) and selects which slitters will be used to cut the customers rolls to the proper width.
Program communicates to the Rx3i PLC through Modbus TCP/IP 
Roll widths are received and shrinkage is added to each roll as per operator's request. Operations can disable inner slitters or put slitters out of service.
Total runtime is calculated for each slitter for band and blade lifecycle.
# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Running Version 2.7
2.	Build in debug and release
3.	Copy X64\release to operations computer and rename folder to Slitter Version 2.7
4.	Create shortcut on desktop for operations

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
